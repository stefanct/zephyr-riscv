Notes for CC3200:
 * CC3200 has no integrated flash Memory.
 * TI bootloader takes first 16Kb of the 256Kb SRAM, so app must start at
   0x20004000.  CC3200 Kconfig must set SRAM size to 240Kb or less, since
   Zephyr computes TOP_OF_MEMORY (used for stack) based on SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS
   + SRAM_SIZE.

Notes for CC3220SF:
 * Text must start at 0x800 offset in flash.  The first 0x800 bytes are
   reserved for the flash header.
 * See CONFIG_TEXT_SECTION_OFFSET.
